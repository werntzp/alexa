This is for a Simpsons Chalkboard gag skill. If you say "Alexa, ask Simpsons Chalkboard for a gag", it will return a random chalkboard gag from the Simpsons show opening along with the season and episode number. 

Example:

Saying "Alexa, ask Simpsons Chalkboard for a gag" will return "I will not waste chalk, Season 1, Bart the Genius"
